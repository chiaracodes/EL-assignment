### Part A

### Part B
Implementing a classification and regression algorithm for decision tree.

In dicisiontree.py we have two main class DecisionTreeRegressor for implementing the regression and DecisionTreeClassifier for implementing classification.
We have given examples on how to implement these classes and compared its accuracy with that of the sickit-learn library.
