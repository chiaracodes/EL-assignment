### Part A

Cyberbullying classification: multiple and binary.
The code related to this part can be found in the Cyberbullying_model folder. 

Inside this folder we find 3 jupyter notebook files:

- DT_RF_Boosting_Maria: This contains all the proprocessing, feature engineering and modelling related to the following models: decision tree, random forest and boosting algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. This was developed by Maria Isabel Vera.

- Bagging with SVM Cheng:

- MultiNaiveBayes_BinarySVM_Lauren:

### Part B
Implementing a classification and regression algorithm for decision tree.

In dicisiontree.py we have two main class DecisionTreeRegressor for implementing the regression and DecisionTreeClassifier for implementing classification.
We have given examples on how to implement these classes and compared its accuracy with that of the sickit-learn library.
